# Unhelp
---
_Unhelp_, or _unhelpful help_ is, as the name suggests, unhelpful. It normally is commentary disguised as help, and should be avoided at all costs. At best, unhelp provides clutter and noise to situations. At worst, it can throw a bad situation into catastrophe, while alienating customers and colleagues alike.

## Time is money

Don't be blas√© about the damage that unhelp can do. Help is supposed to save money. Developers who are blocked are not billable, releasing features, or fixing expensive bugs. Help is supposed to free that time to make developers more efficient, thus saving or making money. Unhelp is a time sink, and therefore costs money.

## Helpfulness is not a point system


## A few real world (true) examples

### The unvaluable hindsight lecture
Once, while working on a project, I became stuck on the right (git) workflow to achieve to solve the myriad branches and third parties working on the monolithic code base we were trying to improve. Work and productivity was grinding to a halt. I decided to ask a senior colleague who was a recognised expert in Agile and workflow. However, they took the opportunity instead to say what we had done wrong. Calmly pointing out that they were right, but that we were in the state we were in, I asked what to do. The lecture of what could have been done to avoid this continued. The meeting took up about 45 minutes of time, that in the end was non-billable - a _sin_ in agency land.

If you are onboard a plane, and you discover all of the flight crew are unconscious from food poisoning, the last thing you need when contacting the air traffic controller is a lecture on how the food should have been checked for poison.
"But we're about to crash! How do I land?"
"Well, let me tell you how you could have avoided this situation...."

There is plenty of time _after_ a problem to explain how the problem could have been avoided in the first place. During a problem is not the time to explain how to avert it. If you feel you need to make sure this doesn't occur again, make sure that someone makes a note for a retrospective/drains-up/post mortem of the crisis. Then go fix the problem, or, if you can't, step back.


## Spotting your own unhelpful self
Signatures of Unhelp:
- Are you merely showing how smart you are by commenting on this issue?
- What value are you adding by commenting on something? Are you providing vital insight, or pedantry in correcting some minor point?
- Are you mixing up helping with an opportunity to teach/lecture?

## Help

Help should be:

- timely
- pertinent
- explicit
