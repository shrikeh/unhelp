# Unhelp
---
_Unhelp_, or _unhelpful help_ is, as the name suggests, unhelpful. It normally is commentary disguised as help, and should be avoided at all costs. At best, unhelp provides clutter and noise to situations. At worst, it can throw a bad situation into catastrophe, while alienating customers and colleagues alike.

## Spotting your own unhelpful self
Signatures of Unhelp:
- Are you merely showing how smart you are by commenting on this issue?
- What value are you adding by commenting on something? Are you providing vital insight, or pedantry in correcting some minor point?
- Are you mixing up help with an opportunity to teach/lecture?

## Help

Help should be:

- timely
- pertinent
- explicit
